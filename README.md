# BookStock
### BookStock is a website for warehouse management. Any item's stock may be uploaded to this website, and it will be added to your existing stock number. When an item is delivered, the number of stocks available is reduced with a single click. You may add new goods to your inventory with suitable descriptions and stock quantities. A user can review items that he or she has added. Any item in the inventory can be deleted, which will also remove it from the database.
